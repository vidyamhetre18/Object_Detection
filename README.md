# Object_Detection
Utilized YOLOv8, a state-of-art object detection algorithm, to develop a bearing detection system capable of identifying bearings within industrial environments. The project involved training a deep learning model on a custom dataset of bearing images and integrating the trained model into a Python script using OpenCV for real-time detection.
